# Contribution Guides  
In the spirit of open source software development, jQuery always encourages community code contribution. To help you get started and before you jump into writing code, be sure to read these important contribution guidelines thoroughly:  

1.[Getting Involved](https://contribute.jquery.org/)  

2.[Core Style Guide](https://contribute.jquery.org/)

3.[Writing Code for jQuery Foundation Projects](https://contribute.jquery.org/)

# Environments in which to use jQuery
* [Browser support](https://jquery.com/)  

* jQuery also supports Node, browser extensions, and other non-browser environments.  

# What you need to build your own jQuery  

To build jQuery, you need to have the latest Node.js/npm and git 1.7 or later. Earlier versions might work, but are not supported.

For Windows, you have to download and install [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

OS X users should install Homebrew. Once [Homebrew]() is installed, run `brew install git` to install git, and `brew install node` to install Node.js.

Linux/BSD users should use their appropriate package managers to install git and Node.js, or build from source if you swing that way. Easy-peasy. 

# How to build your own jQuery  

Clone a copy of the main jQuery git repo by running:

`git clone git://github.com/jquery/jquery.git`  

Enter the jquery directory and run the build script:

`cd` jquery `&&` npm run build  
  
The built version of jQuery will be put in the `dist/` subdirectory, along with the minified copy and associated map file.

If you want to create custom build or help with jQuery development, it would be better to install [grunt command line interface](https://github.com/) as a global package:

`npm install -g grunt-cli ` 

Make sure you have grunt installed by testing:

`grunt -V`

Now by running the `grunt` command, in the jquery directory, you can build a full version of jQuery, just like with an `npm run build`command:

`grunt`

There are many other tasks available for jQuery Core:

`grunt -help`
